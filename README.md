# curt-url-shortener
There is always an 'Hello World" for each languages/frameworks. URL Shortner is the one for Serverless.

I used [Cloud Function for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) that are very easy to use.

# Let's try

Go to https://us-central1-curt-url-shortener.cloudfunctions.net/curt/encode?url=http://www.google.com

And the service will return a 5 lenght string, let call it **shortCode**.

Go to https://us-central1-curt-url-shortener.cloudfunctions.net/curt/decode/shortCode and you'll be redirected to the shorted site.

# Why 'curt'

In [Neapolitan](https://it.wiktionary.org/wiki/c%C3%B9rto) we use 'c√πrto' to say "short" which is pronounced as 'curt'.
